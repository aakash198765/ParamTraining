/*
let animal = Object.create(Animal.prototype);

Object.create(obj) creates a new object, and sets obj as the new object's prototype. Recall that the prototype is like the "recipe" for creating an object. By setting the prototype of animal to be Animal's prototype, you are effectively giving the animal instance the same "recipe" as any other instance of Animal.

animal.eat();
animal instanceof Animal;

The instanceof method here would return true.
