/* 
All objects in JavaScript (with a few exceptions) have a prototype. Also, an objectâ€™s prototype itself is an object.

function Bird(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

typeof Bird.prototype;

Because a prototype is an object, a prototype can have its own prototype! In this case, the prototype of Bird.prototype is Object.prototype:

Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Bird.prototype);

function Dog(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

let beagle = new Dog("Snoopy");

Dog.prototype.isPrototypeOf(beagle);  // yields true

// Fix the code below so that it evaluates to true
Object.prototype.isPrototypeOf(Dog.prototype); // Dog.prototype is an object // and, Prototype of an Object is Object itself
